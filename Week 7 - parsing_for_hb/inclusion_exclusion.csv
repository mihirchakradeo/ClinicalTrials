Such management must be monitored in close cooperation with an         endocrinologist or primary care physician, as defined by at least three contacts during the         previous 12 months. If an endocrinologist did not participate in the ongoing management         effort during the past year, then an independent endocrinologist must assess the adequacy         of the management efforts prior to enrollment.)

Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test                   is needed.                11. Potential participant is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center                   to an area not covered by another clinical center during the two years.                12. Evidence of traction detachment involving or threatening the macula.                    • If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam                   to confirm eligibility, then it is recommended that assessment be performed with                   ultrasound as standard care.                13. Evidence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.                    • If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam                   to confirm eligibility, then it is recommended that assessment be performed with                   ultrasound as standard care.                14. Evidence of neovascular glaucoma (iris or angle neovascularization is not an                   exclusion).                15. Known diabetic macular edema (DME), defined as either                16.

Age >= 18 years Participants <18 years old are not being included because              proliferative diabetic retinopathy is so rare in this age group that the diagnosis may              be questionable.            2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)          Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is         present:            -  Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes            -  Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes            -  Documented diabetes by American Diabetes Association and/or World Health Organization              criteria 4. Able and willing to provide informed consent. 5. Patient is willing and              able to undergo vitrectomy within next 2 weeks and the vitrectomy can be scheduled              within that time frame.               6. Vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from proliferative              diabetic retinopathy, for which intervention is deemed necessary.                 -  Note: Prior panretinal photocoagulation is neither a requirement nor an                   exclusion.                 -  Subhyaloid hemorrhage alone does not make an eye eligible; however, presence of                   subhyaloid hemorrhage in addition to the criteria above will not preclude                   participation provided the investigator is comfortable with either treatment                   regimen.                    7. Immediate vitrectomy not required (investigator and participant are willing to                   wait at least 4 months to see if hemorrhage clears sufficiently with                   anti-vascular endothelial growth factor without having to proceed to vitrectomy).                    8. Visual acuity letter score ≤78 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32) and at                   least light perception.                    9. Investigators should use particular caution when considering enrollment of an                   eye with visual acuity letter score 69 to 78 (approximate Snellen equivalent                   20/32 to 20/40) to ensure that the need for vitrectomy and its potential benefits                   outweigh the potential risks.
